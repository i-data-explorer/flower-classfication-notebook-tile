## Iris Flower Classification
- Iris flower dataset contains 50 instances of 3 classes of Iris plants(Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolor & Iris-virginica)
- Goal of Iris flower classification problem is to classify an unseen Iris plant.
- Keras and Tensorflow is used to develop neural network model for this multi-class classification problem.
- Finally, evaluating the model with kfold cross validation using scikit-learn.
