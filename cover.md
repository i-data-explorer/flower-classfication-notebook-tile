# Flower classification notebook

![](/_images/iris-image-1.jpg)

## What is the notebook about?
Iris flower dataset contains 50 instances of 3 classes of Iris plants(Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolor & Iris-virginica)
Goal of Iris flower classification problem is to classify an unseen Iris flower into the three distinct sub-species.

## What algorithms are used?
* Keras and Tensorflow is used to develop a feed-forward neural network model for this multi-class classification problem.
* The model is evaluated using K-fold Cross Validation method present in the scikit-learn library.

## What is the content of the notebook?
This notebook indulges in Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), before plunging into training a simple Feed Forward Neural Network (FFNN) using the Iris Dataset to label the records with the correct subspecies. The model is then evaluated using the Cross Validation (CV) technique and a mean accuracy of 95% is observed.
